# About me
I'm 3rd year Computer Science at the University of Warwick. I love anything HPC, C++, and Rust, and am dipping my toes into the world of startups :) Also a part of the exec team at the Warwick Coding Society, let me know if you have any questions!

Big contribution gap as I'm doing full-time work for half the year :(
